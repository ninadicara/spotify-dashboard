# Spotify Dashboard

The `.Rmd` file will generate a `.html` dashboard describing an individual's Spotify data. It is built with R Markdown, Plotly and FlexDashboard. 

This dashboard will accept a `.csv` where each row contains a listening event in an individuals Spotify listening history. 
It is designed to work with the data exported from the [Spotify Rehydrator](https://github.com/DynamicGenetics/Spotify-Rehydrator).
