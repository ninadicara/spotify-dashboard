Over Space
=====================================  

### How do your songs group together? {.no-title}

Below are all your songs mapped onto a graph. <br>
 
How does it work? First, the analysis groups together songs that are similar based on the features of the song like those in the previous plot, such as *acousticness* or *valence* (this uses a clustering algorithm called 'k-means'). The analysis then reduces all the information about the song that it can to two variables, so that they can be plotted on a 2-d graph (this is known as 'dimension reduction'). The result is the graph below, where each of your songs has been assigned to a group, given by the colour, and put somewhere on the graph. 

<br>
You can see what each of the points on the graph is by hovering over it to get the track and artist name. Double-click on the graph to go back to the default view.

```{r k_means_clustering, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Create a subset with numeric features and the names we eventually want as tooltips as the index.
spotify_num <- spotify %>% 
  select(trackName, artistName, all_of(music_features)) %>%
  mutate(name = sprintf("Track: %s<br>Artist: %s", trackName, artistName)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  select(-c(trackName, artistName))

# Make the trackID the index 
rownames(spotify_num) <- spotify_num$name
spotify_num$name <- NULL # Delete trackID as a column, it's the index now. 

# Now scale   
spotify_num <- spotify_num %>% 
  scale()

# Run the kmeans algorithm
km <- kmeans(spotify_num, 3, nstart = 25)

# Dimension reduction using PCA
res.pca <- prcomp(spotify_num,  scale = TRUE)
# Coordinates of individuals
ind.coord <- as.data.frame(get_pca_ind(res.pca)$coord)
# Add clusters obtained using the K-means algorithm
ind.coord$cluster <- factor(km$cluster)

cluster_plot <- ggplot(ind.coord, 
                       aes(x = Dim.1, 
                           y = Dim.2, 
                           text = row.names(spotify_num), 
                           color=cluster)) +
                geom_point() + 
                theme_void() +  # Remove all axes and labels
                theme(legend.position = "none") +
                scale_colour_brewer(palette="Set2")
