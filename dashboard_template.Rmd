Over Space {data-orientation=rows}

Row {data-height=55}

### How do your songs group together? 

<!-- How does it work? First, the analysis groups together songs that are similar based on the features of the song like those in the previous plot, such as *acousticness* or *valence* (this uses a clustering algorithm called 'k-means'). The analysis then reduces all the information about the song that it can to two variables, so that they can be plotted on a 2-d graph (this is known as 'dimension reduction'). The result is the graph below, where each of your songs has been assigned to a group, given by the colour, and put somewhere on the graph.  -->

```{r k_means_clustering, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Create a subset with numeric features and the names we eventually want as tooltips as the index.
spotify_num <- spotify %>%
  select(trackName, artistName, all_of(music_features)) %>%
  mutate(name = sprintf("Track: %s<br>Artist: %s", trackName, artistName)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  select(-c(trackName, artistName))

# Make the trackID the index
rownames(spotify_num) <- spotify_num$name
spotify_num$name <- NULL # Delete trackID as a column, it's the index now.

# Now scale
spotify_num <- spotify_num %>%
  scale()

# Get the best number of clusters algorithmically
n_clusters <- NbClust(spotify_num, min.nc = 2, method="kmeans", index="rubin")
n_clusters <- n_clusters$Best.nc[[1]]
```

Below are all your songs mapped onto a 2-D space The songs have been grouped into the best fitting `r n_clusters` groups based on their musical features, and each of these is a different colour on the graph. The closer the songs are on the graph, the more similar their features are. <br>

This plot is *interactive*. You can hover over each point to see the track and artist name. Zoom in and out using the buttons in the top right hand corner! 

What do you think? Do the groups make sense?
